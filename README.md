## Background
> Four Silos Brewery is a local business in Gilbert offering a wide variety of beers and IPAs, and you can savor them with tasty side dishes and meals.
> They regularly host events, positioning themselves as a gathering space for the local community.
> Their website serves as both an information resource and an online ordering platform.


## Problem
> The existing website reduced user functionality through challenging user interface decisions and disorganized information structure.


## Process
> Through user testing and content evaluation, we, as a team, identified a need for clearer information architecture.
> This led to decisions such as merging duplicated content and emphasizing key categories to better respond to customer needs.
> To obtain more customer perspectives, we crafted a persona being a regular local visitor to guide design decisions.
> With that in mind, I preserved the existing modern, monochromatic visual theme while redesigning the layout to enhance usability and flow.


## Result
> The redesigned mockup improves clarity and user experience by reorganizing content in a clear hierarchy and simplifying navigation,
> potentially reducing the customerâ€™s confusion and frustration while engaging with the website.
